# teaching-assistant-pretraining-tests
Collection of my _New Assistant Recruitment (NAR)_ 2016-1 pre-training tests

I am fully aware of the 'hard-to-read' format (ugly spaces, indentation, etc) as these were coded before I even realized how monstrous the coding style is.

Those were coded under a very limited time (it was 1 case per session... I think), and I'm too lazy to refactor the coding style now.

Also note that I used some undefined behaviour ***C*** code like ```fflush(stdin)``` which currently I would use ```while( (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n')``` instead.
