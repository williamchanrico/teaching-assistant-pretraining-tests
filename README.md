Collection of my _New Assistant Recruitment (NAR)_ 2016-1 pre-training tests

* ```T122```: Trainee Code
* ```H1 - H4```: Day 1 - Day 4
* ```LevelUp```: Exam at the end of each week
* ```Mandatory```: Like a homework that must be completed before the exam each week
* ```C```: C Language (Week 1)
* ```DS```: Data Structure (Week 2)
* ```JavaI```: Java Part One (Week 3)
* ```JavaII```: Java Part Two (Week 4)

I am fully aware of the 'hard-to-read' format (ugly spaces, indentation, etc) as these were coded before I even realized how monstrous the coding style is.

Those were coded under a very limited time (it was 1 case per session... I think), and I'm too lazy to refactor the coding style now.

Also note that I used some undefined behaviour ***C*** code like ```fflush(stdin)``` which currently I would use ```while( (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n')``` instead.
